# AIN442 - Practicum in Natural Language Processing
This repository contains a collection of natural language processing (NLP) assignments exploring both foundational algorithms and modern deep learning models. It also includes custom implementations of tokenization and learning mechanisms.

## üìÅ Contents

### üß± Basic NLP Components

1. **Token Segmenter**
   - Custom rule-based token segmentation
   - Handles punctuation, whitespace, and special characters

2. **Token Learner**
   - Learns frequent patterns or tokens from raw text
   - Can be used for vocabulary construction and subword units

### ü§ñ Classic ML Models

4. **Logistic Regression**
   - Text classification using TF-IDF features
   - Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

5. **Naive Bayes**
   - NB for text classification
   - Compared with logistic regression on performance and speed

### üß† Deep Learning

6. **BERT Model**
   - Fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT for classification tasks
   - Uses HuggingFace Transformers
   - Training on GPU with attention to overfitting and validation metrics

### üåê LLM Integration

7. **Google Gemini API**
   - Prompt-based interaction with Google's Gemini LLM
   - Task examples: summarization, "title"ing given text, question answering
